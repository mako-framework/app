Mako is a lightweight UTF-8 compatible and easy to use PHP framework based on the MVC architectural design pattern.

## Requirements

Mako requires PHP 5.3.1 or higher (PHP 5.3.7 or higher is recommended) as well as the mbstring and PDO extensions.

## Installation

Mako can be installed using a single command thanks to [composer](https://packagist.org):

```
